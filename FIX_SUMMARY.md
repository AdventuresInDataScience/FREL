FIX SUMMARY: Data Shape Correction
===================================

Date: October 1, 2025

ISSUE IDENTIFIED:
-----------------
In dev/main.py, the stacking operation for DataFrame columns containing arrays
was potentially incorrect:

OLD CODE:
```python
X_price_train = np.stack([train_df[col].values for col in price_cols], axis=-1)
```

PROBLEM:
When DataFrame columns contain arrays (object dtype), .values returns an object
array where each element is itself an array. np.stack may not properly unpack
this, leading to incorrect shapes.


FIX APPLIED:
------------
Added explicit unpacking with nested np.stack:

NEW CODE:
```python
X_price_train = np.stack([np.stack(train_df[col].values) for col in price_cols], axis=-1)
```

This ensures:
1. Inner np.stack(train_df[col].values) converts (n_samples,) object array 
   → (n_samples, lookback) float array
2. Outer np.stack([...], axis=-1) stacks across features
   → (n_samples, lookback, 5) final shape


VALIDATION ADDED:
-----------------
Added shape assertions for early error detection:

```python
assert X_price_train.shape == (len(train_df), CFG['lookback'], 5), \
    f"X_price_train shape mismatch: got {X_price_train.shape}, expected ({len(train_df)}, {CFG['lookback']}, 5)"
assert X_meta_train.shape == (len(train_df), 8), \
    f"X_meta_train shape mismatch: got {X_meta_train.shape}, expected ({len(train_df)}, 8)"
```

Added for both training and test data.


DEBUG OUTPUT ADDED:
-------------------
Added shape printing for visibility:

```python
print(f"X_price_train shape: {X_price_train.shape}")
print(f"X_meta_train shape: {X_meta_train.shape}")
```


FILES MODIFIED:
---------------
1. dev/main.py - Fixed stacking logic and added validation

FILES VERIFIED (No changes needed):
------------------------------------
1. src/predictor.py - Stacking operations are correct:
   - Line 110: Stacks plain arrays from dict (not DataFrame)
   - Line 257-258: Stacks pre-shaped arrays from list

2. All model definitions - Input shapes are consistent:
   - price_in: (lookback, 5)
   - meta_in: (8,)


DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS CREATED:
--------------------------
1. dev/test_stack.py - Tests numpy stacking behavior with object arrays
2. dev/check_shapes.py - Analyzes actual dataset structure
3. SHAPE_VERIFICATION.md - Complete technical analysis
4. FIX_SUMMARY.md - This document


EXPECTED BEHAVIOR AFTER FIX:
-----------------------------
✅ X_price_train.shape = (n_train, 200, 5)
✅ X_price_test.shape = (n_test, 200, 5)
✅ X_meta_train.shape = (n_train, 8)
✅ X_meta_test.shape = (n_test, 8)

✅ All neural models receive correct input shapes
✅ LightGBM receives correctly flattened input: (n_samples, 1008)
   where 1008 = 200*5 + 8

✅ Predictor.predict() works with both single and batch inputs
✅ Optimal action search produces correct shapes


TESTING RECOMMENDATIONS:
-------------------------
1. Run with small dataset first (n=1000) to verify shapes
2. Check assertion messages if any failures occur
3. Verify printed shapes match expectations
4. Run diagnostic scripts to understand data structure if needed


TECHNICAL NOTES:
----------------
The fix addresses the pandas behavior where:
- DataFrame columns with array values have dtype=object
- .values on such columns returns np.ndarray with dtype=object
- Each element in this array is itself an np.ndarray
- np.stack may treat these as opaque objects rather than unpacking them

The nested np.stack approach explicitly handles this case:
- Inner stack unpacks the object array
- Outer stack combines across features

This is the standard approach for handling DataFrame columns containing arrays.
